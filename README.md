I made this in a couple hours? Mostly just trying to explore NativePHP. Fun-- would love to do it more-- but this isn't anything special.

Install:
composer install 

php artisan native:install

npm install -D tailwindcss (make sure tailwind is installed or NativePHP will yell at you)

php artisan native:serve
